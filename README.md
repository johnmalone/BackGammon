BackGammon
==========

First python project - a curses backgammon game

Mainly aimed at learning python. 

Currently supports human v human, human v computer and computer v computer. The computer AI is little more than picking a 
random move at the moment and there are various crashes that I need to address. 

To run:

python3 main.py


* select H C or T for human computer or testing
* enter a valid move with:
 * &lt;source pip&gt; &lt;dest pip&gt;
 * EG:
 * 12 14
